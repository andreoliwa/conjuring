# Features

## Merge any local `tasks.py` file with global Conjuring tasks

If you create a `tasks.py` in a project, it will override the Conjuring
`tasks.py` on your home dir.
You will only see your local project tasks.

To avoid that, go to your home dir and run:

```shell
invoke conjuring.init
```

This will create an `~/.invoke.yaml` file and rename your main tasks file to `~/conjuring_init.py`.

For more details, read about [default configuration values on Configuration â€”
Invoke documentation](https://docs.pyinvoke.org/en/stable/concepts/configuration.html#default-configuration-values).

## Use all global Conjuring tasks provided by this package

If you want to use all tasks included in this package, you can import them all.

```python
from conjuring import *

namespace = cast_all_spells()
```

Run `invoke --list` from any directory, and you will see all Conjuring tasks.

## Only include the global Conjuring tasks you want (opt-in mode)

You may want to choose which Conjuring modules and tasks you want to use.

Suppose you only want:

- AWS;
- Kubernetes;
- pre-commit;
- Python;
- all tasks that install anything.

This is how you can do it:

```python
from conjuring import *

namespace = cast_only_spells("aws*", "k8s*", "pre-commit*", "py*", "*install")
```

## Use all Conjuring tasks excluding some (opt-out mode)

You may want to use all Conjuring modules and tasks, except for a few.

Suppose you want all Conjuring tasks except media and OneDrive tasks.
This is the way:

```python
from conjuring import *

namespace = cast_all_spells_except("media*", "onedrive*")
```

## Display your custom task modules conditionally

Some modules under the `spells` directory have a `should_display_tasks` boolean
function to control whether the tasks are displayed or not.

The `conjuring.visibility` module has boolean functions that can be reused by
your modules and tasks.

Example from the `conjuring.spells.git` module:

```python
from conjuring.visibility import is_git_repo, ShouldDisplayTasks

should_display_tasks: ShouldDisplayTasks = is_git_repo
```

Other use cases:

- [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry/) tasks: display only when
  there is a `pyproject.toml` in the current dir;
- [pre-commit](https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit) tasks: display only
  when there is a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file in the current dir.

## Display your custom individual tasks conditionally

A task can have its own visibility settings, even if the owner module is
configured to not display tasks.

```python
from invoke import task
from conjuring.visibility import MagicTask
from random import randint


@task(klass=MagicTask)
def an_always_visible_task(c):
    """A MagicTask is always visible by default.

    It will always be displayed in every directory,
        regardless of the module ``should_display_tasks()`` function.
    """
    pass


@task(klass=MagicTask, should_display=lambda: bool(randint(0, 1)))
def a_conditionally_visible_task(c):
    """You can use any boolean function to determine visibility."""
    pass
```

Use case:

- you want to group tasks in a module, with a prefix and conditional display of tasks;
- you still want some individual tasks to always be displayed;
- or you want different conditions to display certain tasks.

## Merge your project tasks with the global reusable tasks

Create local `conjuring*.py` files, and they will be merged with the `tasks.py`
in your home dir.
Your project dir can be anywhere under your home dir.

1. Create `~/path/to/your/project/conjuring_foo.py` with Invoke tasks.

   ```python
   from invoke import task


   @task
   def my_foo(c):
       """My foo task."""
       pass
   ```

2. Create another `~/path/to/your/project/conjuring_bar.py` file with more
   Invoke tasks.

   ```python
   from invoke import task


   @task
   def my_bar(c):
       """My bar task."""
       pass
   ```

3. The task list in your project dir will show tasks from all files, including
   the home dir task list.

   ```shell
   $ cd ~/path/to/your/project/
   $ invoke --list
   Available tasks:

     my-bar               My bar task.
     my-foo               My foo task.
     <... the global Conjuring tasks will show up here...>
   ```

## Prefix task names of your custom module

If the module defines this boolean constant with a value of `True`, then the
name of the module will be added as a prefix to tasks.

Example for the `conjuring.spells.pre_commit` module:

```python
SHOULD_PREFIX = True
```

All the tasks of this module will have a `pre-commit.` prefix when you run
`invoke --list`.
